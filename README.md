## Contributing

### Contributing code

Try to use pull requests as much as possible, so we can keep the commit clutter to a minimum. For this, make a fork of the repository using the `Fork` button, and commit your changes to that. You can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for how to create a pull request from that fork.

When committing, use `dart format` or `flutter format` to format your code, to keep it neat.

Always make sure that your code runs and works the way it should *before* you commit. Run any tests we may have. We don't want broken code.

Make sure your commit messages are descriptive enough to know what you did by just looking at it. You can read here on how to [write descriptive commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

### Running

The `bs.bat` script file can be used for running and building the app and server from one place on Windows. It will run `[dart|fltter] pub get`, along with the command to build or run the part.
```zsh
./bs <run|build> <app|server> [args]
```

If you don't want to use this script, or it dosen't work for you, you can use the following commands:
```zsh
dart run lib/server.dart # Run the server
flutter run # Run the app
dart compile exe lib/server.dart # Build the server
flutter build apk # Build the app as an APK file
```

The app can be run as long as Flutter is installed and a device is available. You can install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) to get an emulator and tools, allowing you to run Android without a real Android tablet. *Running the server does not require an emulator, but may require Flutter to be installed.*
If Android Studio's emulator is too taxing on your computer, there are alternatives, such as [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) or [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/).
